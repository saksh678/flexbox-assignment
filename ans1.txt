    flexbox:- flexbox is primarily design for one dimentional layout, giving space and aligning items 
    alone the single axis(either horizontaly or vertically).
    grid:- css grid is design for two dimentional layout, allowing you to define both rows and columns.
           css grid is ideal of complex based design like magnazing layout , forms , and any layout 
           where content need to be placed in a precise grid structure.
    choosing between flexbox and grid depend on your specific layout requirement:-
    flexbox when you use in a single axis. such as when you create a navbar, header then you use
    flexbox for one dimensional layout.
    if you want to create two dimensional layout such as it have multiple column and row, then you 
    use grid css beacuse it's work in a both dimension. (rows and column).
    Or somehow do you need to apply both the css grid and flexbox in a single project, on the based
    of the requirement.
